## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

This project analyzes the crime rate in Boston, Massachusett. This is an exploration analysis on the status of crime in multiple aspects such as day, hour, type of crimes, etc... The goal of this project is to identify the solution to an alarming rampage of crime rate in Boston, which might suggest policy changes around the world.
